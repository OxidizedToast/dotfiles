## Introduction to C++
C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that is widely used in various applications, from game development to systems programming. It is an extension of the C programming language and provides object-oriented features.

## Setting Up Your Environment
To start programming in C++, you'll need to set up your development environment:
1. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Download and install an IDE such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
2. **Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

## Basic Syntax
Here are the fundamental elements of C++ syntax:

### Hello World Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Variables and Data Types
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    char grade = 'A';
    std::string name = "John Doe";

    std::cout << "Name: " << name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Height: " << height << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Grade: " << grade << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Control Structures
Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program:

### If-Else Statement
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number = 10;

    if (number > 0) {
        std::cout << "The number is positive." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The number is not positive." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### For Loop
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        std::cout << "i = " << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Functions
Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks:

### Function Definition
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet();
    return 0;
}
```

### Function with Parameters
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void greet(std::string name) {
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    greet("Bob");
    return 0;
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming
C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows you to create classes and objects:

### Class Definition
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;

    void introduce() {
        std::cout << "Hi, I'm " << name << " and I'm " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person person;
    person.name = "Alice";
    person.age = 30;
    person.introduce();

    return 0;
}
```
